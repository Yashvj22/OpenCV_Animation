# 🚫 Don't Drink and Drive: A Visual Story with Python (OpenCV) 🚗  

This repository showcases two impactful projects I created using **Python** and **OpenCV**:  
1. **An animation video** emphasizing the critical message, "Don't Drink & Drive."  
2. **A fun and interactive GIF** capturing the frustrations of coding and the need to de-stress.  

## 🔹 Project 1: The Animation Story  
### Description  
The animation tells a compelling story that begins in a bar 🍻, transitions to a risky decision to drive 🚗, and ends with a tragic accident 💥. It aims to raise awareness about the dangers of drunk driving and deliver a powerful social message.  

### Features  
- **Scene Design**: Roads, vehicles, and characters brought to life with OpenCV functions like `cv2.line`, `cv2.circle`, and `cv2.rectangle`.  
- **Impactful Messaging**: The animation displays key messages like **"Don't Drink & Drive"** using `cv2.putText`.  
- **Interactive Elements**: Mouse events implemented using `cv2.setMouseCallback` for dynamic scene creation.  
- **Frame Display**: Seamless animation created using `cv2.imshow` and `cv2.waitKey`.

## 🔹 Project 2: The GIF  
### Description  
This fun and engaging GIF captures the emotional rollercoaster of coding frustrations 🐞. It features a creative interaction where a keyboard turns into a drum 🥁, symbolizing the need to de-stress during tough debugging sessions.  

### Features  
- **Dynamic Interaction**: Mouse-based input to create animations.  
- **GIF Creation**: Frames are looped to simulate a smooth and visually appealing animation.  
- **Key OpenCV Functions**:  
  - `cv2.line`, `cv2.circle` for drawing shapes.  
  - `cv2.putText` for adding text to frames.  
  - `cv2.imshow`, `cv2.waitKey` for frame-by-frame visualization.
